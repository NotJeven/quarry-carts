### Quarry Carts
by Jeven  
v1.0

### About

Quarry Carts is a simple escort/payload Minecraft PvP map. Two teams battle to escort
their minecart payload to the end of their track. The first team to reach the end of
their track with their payload wins. Players are outfited with protective armor, a
sword, a bow, a shovel, and a pile of dirt to manage their defences and offensive pushes.

Quarry Carts requires 2 players, and can comfortably play with up to 20.

### Technical information

To install, extract the folder "Quarry Carts v1.0" from the 
downloaded "Quarry Carts v1.0.zip". Then move the "Quarry Carts v1.0"
folder into a Minecraft server directory. Finally set the server.properties
"level-name" property to "Eris 2.2".

For installation help feel free to tweet me your questions (@NotJeven).

Quarry Carts v1.0 is released for unmodified (vanilla) Minecraft 1.12.2.

The supported Minecraft versions will also be added to the Quarry Carts webpage 
(https://github.com/notjeve/quarry-carts).

I recommend setting announce-player-achievements to false in server.properties.
announce-player-achievements=false
